A 1,000-pound Westminster bell hung in one of the towers until a devastating fire in 1905 destroyed most of the building. After the fire, Main Building was rebuilt as \"College Hall,\" in an Italian style inspired by the town hall in Siena, Italy, with a castellated roof line instead of gables, and a single tower. Nashville schoolchildren raised money to buy a 2,000-lb. bronze bell for the rebuilt structure.  In 1939, College Hall was renamed in memory of James H. Kirkland, Vanderbilt's second chancellor, who led the university through 44 formative years.

Machine and forge shops and steam boilers for the new campus heating plant were in the basement, classrooms and laboratories for Botany, Geology, and Engineering on upper floors.

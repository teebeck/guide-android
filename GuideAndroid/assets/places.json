It was the first academic addition to the campus after World War II. Engineering alumnus A. J. Dyer, founder of Nashville bridge company, was a major contributor to the building fund and the principal donor of mechanical engineering laboratories, added in 1958. The building was renamed Jacobs Hall in 1996 in honor of Dillard Jacobs, Founder's medalist of the School of Engineering's class of 1932 and a professor of engineering at Vanderbilt for nearly 30 years. In 2001, construction was completed that transformed the old building into a new School of Engineering complex. The old central wing was demolished and replaced by Featheringill Hall, named for alumnus and lead donor William W. Featheringill, and the remaining wings of Jacobs were renovated.",

Hibbs, Alumni Hall represents the Collegiate Gothic style and was the original student center on Vanderbilt’s campus, and acted as such for nearly 50 years until Sarratt Student Center opened in 1974. The driving force behind the building of Alumni Hall was to memorialize the Vanderbilt men who fought and died in World War I. This campaign was brought forward in March, 1919, by the Vanderbilt Alumni Association board. This shaped one of the distinguishing features of the building, which is located in the Memorial Room on the second floor. The names of the 44 Vanderbilt casualties are carved in stone above the two fireplace mantles, located at either end of the room. Over the years Alumni Hall has served many purposes, from the original student center to administrative offices. Currently Alumni Hall houses the Faculty Senate, the Vanderbilt Writing Studio, and the Department of Alumni Relations, among others.",

In 1915, the school became Peabody Demonstration School, located in the basement of Jesup Psychological Building on Peabody's 21st Ave. campus. In 1925, the present building was completed on Edgehill Ave., designed in the classical style. When Peabody College closed the demonstration school in 1974, a group of parents, alumni, students and teachers formed University School of Nashville as an independent institution. Additions that have been made to the original building include a new west wing completed in 1985, the Sperling Center in 1989, the Gordon Wing in 1997, and the Tibbott Center for Visual Arts in 2003. The school is a popular choice for children of Vanderbilt staff.",

A 1,000-pound Westminster bell hung in one of the towers until a devastating fire in 1905 destroyed most of the building. After the fire, Main Building was rebuilt as \"College Hall,\" in an Italian style inspired by the town hall in Siena, Italy, with a castellated roof line instead of gables, and a single tower. Nashville schoolchildren raised money to buy a 2,000-lb. bronze bell for the rebuilt structure.  In 1939, College Hall was renamed in memory of James H. Kirkland, Vanderbilt's second chancellor, who led the university through 44 formative years. Kirkland Hall underwent exterior and interior renovation in the 1980s and now houses the offices of the chancellor and general officers, deans of the College of Arts and Science and Graduate School, and other administrators.",

The trees were small and young when Science Hall was built in 1880. Machine and forge shops and steam boilers for the new campus heating plant were in the basement, classrooms and laboratories for Botany, Geology, and Engineering on upper floors. Over the years, Old Science provided classrooms and offices for English, Philosophy, and Mathematics; housed the Geology Museum; and in the 1970s was a studio art center. Old Central, once the home of Mr. and Mrs. Henry S. Foote, is the only campus building that antedates the university. Bishop Holland Mctyeire lived here while overseeing construction of the first campus buildings. It was a faculty residence for many years, then housed women students. The departments of Philosophy and Mathematics were here; English and Economic Development were later residents. Old Science and Old Central have survived more than one master plan for the campus that called for their removal. In 1983, the two buildings were connected and restored with funds from Robert G. Benson and the Benson family, creating a single unit that today houses the English and History departments.",

The name Buttrick Hall recognizes Wallace Buttrick (1853-1926), Vanderbilt's principal advocate at the Rockefeller-funded General Education Board where he served as secretary (1902-1917), president (1917-1923), and chairman (1923-1926). GEB's support of academic and medical development at Vanderbilt was inestimable. Buttrick Hall was one of three collegiate Gothic classroom buildings for which GEB gave half the original construction funds.",
